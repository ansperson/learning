# What are the Microsoft Entra ID licenses?

Microsoft Online business services, such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Azure, use Microsoft Entra ID for sign-in activities and to help protect your identities. If you subscribe to any Microsoft Online business service, you automatically get access to Microsoft Entra ID Free.

To enhance your Microsoft Entra implementation, you can also add paid features by upgrading to Microsoft Entra ID P1 or Premium P2 licenses. Microsoft Entra paid licenses are built on top of your existing free directory. The licenses provide self-service, enhanced monitoring, security reporting, and secure access for your mobile users.

## Select Microsoft Entra editions

Microsoft Entra ID comes in four editions: Free, Microsoft 365 Apps, Premium P1, and Premium P2. The Free edition is included with an Azure subscription. The Premium editions are available through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, the Open Volume License Program, and the Cloud Solution Providers program. Azure and Microsoft 365 subscribers can also buy Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 online.
